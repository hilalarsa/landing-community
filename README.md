# Welcome to the Repo!

This repo is dedicated for Hacktoberfest 2019! so welcome, read the whole thing, and join for good (and free t-shirt!)

The basic idea of this repo is to create a Hacktoberfest repo which actually do something more than just listing name and profile url, I know it's for the sake of learning of your first pull request, but hey, its been 3+ years since our first Hacktoberfest, so why don't create more ?

So the first project would be creating a simple landing page, which has theme of "Community". The basic purpose of the page is to :
- Intro landing page of community
- Show list of available community in the area
- --add more here-- 

I'd like a suggestion for this also, so don't hesitate to submit an issue.

# How to Play
Like every game, we need rules to make it goes smoothly and in control, so I propose following stack for the project :

Front-end :
- [React.js](http://reactjs.org)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

View must be mobile responsive, and it's free to use any layout.

What you say ? Our deadline is of course, at the end of October. If this goes bigger, I might create another one with different stack or even different topic (game, library, etc)!
